A simple and mini Quad copter

There are all the software codes about the mini fly robot in this repository. It's actually do it by myself, it includes two aspects. On the one hand,  hardware design, such as AD Electronic circuit design, Electronic components selection and PCB design and PCB welding. On the other hand, software design, from bottom-driven to the control algorithm design.
